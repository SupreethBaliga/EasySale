## Features:
1. Clients have to signup and login after which they can view products, add some frequently ordered products to their favourites section and add products to their cart.
2. After placing the order, it will be reviewed by the seller after which the order will be accepted or rejected by the seller depending upon various factors like availability of raw materials, place of delivery, size of order etc. The order is accepted along with the tentative date by which the order will be delivered.
3. Once the order is accepted by the seller, the client has to pay the advanced payment (30% of the total order amount) through the payment portal.
4. Once the seller receives the advanced payment, the order is started to process. The seller can change the status of the order to keep the client well informed about the order. 
5. Once the order is delivered, the client has to pay the remaining amount either by the portal or directly pay the amount on delivery after which the order status is set to 'Completed'.
